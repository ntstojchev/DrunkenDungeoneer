# DrunkenDungeoneer
Idle dungeon crawler - GMTK Gamejam 2020 entry

Your raid has just finished, but you want to go back to the dungeon right after the celebration. But there's one problem... you had too much beer.

Drunken Dungeoneer is minimalistic idle dungeon crawler, where the player can't control the dungeoneer but can alter it's behaviour while exploring.

How many floors can you survive?

Hints:

While the dungeoneer is sober, he will try to find the shortest path to the exit.
Eating meat would restore random HP point
Drinking speed potion while sober is will help you exit faster
Have fun and share your results!

Drunken Dungeoneer was made under 48h for GMTK Gamejam - Theme: OUT OF CONTROL.
